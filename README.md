# py-cellular-automata

This project started life sometime in 2018 or 2019 as a way to explore tkinter and Conway's (RIP) Game of Life. 
It expanded a bit to allow for other rulesets for cellular automata besides game of life, as well as colors that would change based on the lifetime of a cell for interesting visualizations.

As of September 2021, it is being refactored. Look at the initial commit at your own risk...in my defense, I was just a hobbyist back then and very new to tkinter and Python, and mostly was there for the cool results, not code maintainability.
